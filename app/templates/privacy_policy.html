    <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how this application processes data when you use our service, including when we receive Instagram messaging webhook events.</p>

    <h3>Data we collect and process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App account data</strong>: usernames/emails used to log into this app (for team access and administration).</li>
      <li><strong>Instagram messaging webhook data</strong>: when configured, Instagram/Meta may send webhook events to our endpoint containing message data such as sender/recipient IDs, message IDs, timestamps, and message text.</li>
      <li><strong>Conversation records stored by the app</strong>: the app stores DM conversations and messages in its database so they can be displayed in the Conversations view and used for automation features.</li>
      <li><strong>Automation metadata</strong>: settings (for example, whether auto-reply is enabled), and delivery status/error details for outgoing replies.</li>
      <li><strong>Operational data</strong>: logs and diagnostics (for example, errors and request timing) to keep the service reliable and secure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How we use the data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Receive and process webhooks</strong> to record incoming Instagram DMs and update conversation history.</li>
      <li><strong>Display conversations</strong> inside the app for your team to view and manage.</li>
      <li><strong>Send replies</strong> through the Instagram Graph API when auto-reply is enabled.</li>
      <li><strong>Generate suggested/automatic replies</strong> using AI only when automation features are enabled/configured in the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintain security and performance</strong> (rate limiting, abuse prevention, debugging).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>AI processing (if enabled)</h3>
    <p>If AI reply features are enabled, message text may be processed to generate a reply. We use this processing only to provide messaging automation features and not for unrelated advertising.</p>

    <h3>Data sharing</h3>
    <p>We do not sell personal data. Data may be shared with service providers needed to operate the app (for example, hosting and database providers) and with Meta/Instagram APIs when sending messages or making API calls.</p>

    <h3>Retention</h3>
    <p>
      DM conversations/messages are retained
      {% if retention_days and retention_days|string %}
        for up to <strong>{{ retention_days }}</strong> days (unless a longer period is needed for security, legal, or operational reasons)
      {% else %}
        until you request deletion or an administrator deletes them
      {% endif %}.
      You can request deletion at any time (see the Data Deletion page).
    </p>

    <h3>Your choices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can disable auto-reply in the app settings at any time.</li>
      <li>You can request deletion of stored DM data and related records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>We use reasonable safeguards to protect data, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>
      For privacy questions or deletion requests, contact:
      {% if support_email %}
        <a href="mailto:{{ support_email }}">{{ support_email }}</a>
      {% else %}
        the contact email provided in the app listing.
      {% endif %}
      {% if deletion_days %}
        (we aim to process verified deletion requests within {{ deletion_days }} days).
      {% endif %}
    </p>
